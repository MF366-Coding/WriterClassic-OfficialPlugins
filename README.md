# âš  Deprecation Warning
WriterClassic is officially deprecated.

If you wish to port your plugin to WriterClassic's modern fork ([WriterSharp](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterSharp)), I'd love to announce it'll have a better plugin ecosystem than WriterClassic.

## How to make and upload a plugin?
Please follow [this](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic/wiki/Plugin-API-(v10.1.1-)) article.

The WriterClassic default plugin logo, that sadly went unused, was made by [Norb](https://github.com/norbcodes).

### New Plugin API
Every version that used to run with the old API has been either archived in the [Deprecated Plugins](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic-OfficialPlugins/tree/main/Obsolete_Plugins/) or has been removed for good.

### Refactoring in WriterClassic v10.6.0
Every single version that used the old variable names have been archived or removed as well.

#### RandLooks (By: MF366)
I decided to not maintain RandLooks plugin anymore.
