# How to make and upload a plugin?
Please follow [this](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic/wiki/Plugin-API-(v10.1.1-)) article.

The WriterClassic default plugin logo, that sadly went unused, was made by [Norb](https://github.com/norbcodes).

## New Plugin API (Important!)
- [Norb-GetHash](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic-OfficialPlugins/tree/main/Verified_Plugins/Norb-GetHash)'s Versions 1 and 2 are not compatible with v10.1.1+ because of the new API
- The same happens with [RandLooks](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic-OfficialPlugins/tree/main/Verified_Plugins/RandLooks)'s Version 1
- The rest of the plugins only offer compatibility with v10.1.1+
